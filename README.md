# LatticePrime â€” Self-Updating Asymmetry Mint (PRIME)

LatticePrime is a local, terminal-only engine that:
1) discovers lawful state-difference asymmetries across public signals,
2) generates falsifiable hypotheses with placebo/null channels,
3) harvests only statistically validated events into a verifiable ledger, and
4) retires/retools probes as signals decay.

No customers. No sales. No counterparties. Compliance-first.

## Quick start
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
bash ops/run_local.sh
